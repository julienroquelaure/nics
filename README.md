# nics

This repository contains a project I did for the Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree.

The main dataset comes from the FBIâ€™s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The
NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives.

In addition, we download a U.S. census dataset for comparison against the NICS data.
